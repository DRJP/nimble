\title{Internal function for accessing a member function (method) of a nimbleFunction.  Normally a user will write \code{nf$method(x)} instead of \code{nfMethod(nf, method)(x)}.}
\usage{
nfMethod(nf, methodName)
}
\arguments{
  \item{nf}{a specialized nimbleFunction, i.e. one that has
  already had setup parameters processed} \item{methodName}
  {a character string giving the name of the member function
  to call}
}
\value{
a function that can be called.
}
\description{
access (call) a member function of a nimbleFunction,
including \code{run}.
}
\details{
nimbleFunctions have a default member function called
\code{run}, and may have other member functions provided via
the \code{methods} argument to \code{nimbleFunction}. As an
internal step, the NIMBLE compiler turns \code{nf$method(x)}
into \code{nfMethod(nf, method)(x)}, but a NIMBLE user or
programmer would not normally need to use \code{nfMethod}
directly.

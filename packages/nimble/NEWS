                  PLANNED CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3 

-- use of model$calculate() as an alternative to calculate(model)

-- more general nodeVectors as data structure for referring to collections of nodes as well as replacing nodeFunctionVectors

-- change in how nimbleFunctions are returned and used, so that the reference class object rather than a function wrapping a call to the run method is returned.  this will simplify several aspects of how nimbleFunctions are used.

-- more improvements to compilation speed (we hope)

-- see ISSUES list for many more improvements on our agenda



                     CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2

-- Internal changes to decrease time to build models and nimbleFunctions.

-- Multivariate conjugate updaters are now included in the default MCMC implementation, as well as block updating on scalar and/or multivariate nodes.

-- Vector treatment of is.na and is.nan, so is.na(values(model, nodes)) will work, equivalently to any(is.na(...)) in R.

-- More extensive suite of tests.

Bug fixes

-- Fixed issue with specifying multivariate nodes as rows/columns of matrices

-- Fixed bug in the conjugacy system

-- Fixed bug in compiled version of adaptive block updater

-- Fixed issue with building the NIMBLE package for Windows, as well as cleaning up causes of compiler warnings.

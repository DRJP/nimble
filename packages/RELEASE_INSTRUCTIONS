make sure NEWS is updated with info on changes in latest release

update DESCRIPTION and INSTALL with current version number

for version on nimble website, remove FLIBS from Makevars.in
for CRAN, we need it in there, but it prevents easy source installation on Macs without getting the right version of libgfortran

R CMD build nimble
R CMD INSTALL nimble_${VERSION}.tar.gz
# before running prep_pkg make sure there is a config.R in nimble/R - copy over from another repos if needed but it should not be in the repository per DTL instructions (or do in separate copy of repository: make configure; cd nimble; ./configure)
./prep_pkg # this creates man pages and updates NAMESPACE; note various warnings of things that can go wrong in prep_pkg and make sure these don't happen
(in general you'll need to run prep_pkg twice as first time will generate errors when writing Rd files; also will often need to remove 00LOCK files)

warning about extra space in Rd files occurs (perhaps because of new Roxygen?) in argument lists where \item{} is separated from teh following {} by a newline and some spaces due to indentation appear. A 'fix' is to manually remove the spaces from the Rd files.
This also should work:

for file in `ls nimble/man`; do
    if [ -e /tmp/tmp.Rd ]; then
       rm -rf /tmp/tmp.Rd
    fi
     /bin/cp -i nimble/man/$file /tmp/tmp.Rd 
     sed ':begin;$!N;s/\(\item{.*}\)\n\s*/\1/;tbegin;P;D' /tmp/tmp.Rd > nimble/man/$file
done


R CMD build nimble
R CMD check --as-cran nimble_${VERSION}.tar.gz
# officially this should be done on a development build of R, such as in a BCE or docker instance; for Chris, easiest to do via installing R-devel on SCF

run tests:
in particular check exact results vs previous versions (ignore differences in compilation log info)
types="compareMCMCs copy declare distributions dsl_dists getParam math mcmc models size trunc user"
for type in $types; do
Rscript -e "library(nimble); library(methods); library(testthat); test_package('nimble','$type')" >> /tmp/test-results-v0.5
done

login to nature.berkeley.edu: ssh to your_calnet_id@nature.berkeley.edu and use CalNet password
cd /web/R-nimble/wordpress/src/contrib

cp new .tar.gz there

chmod go+w nimble_${VERSION}.tar.gz

./writePackages

go to website: R-nimble.org/login and login 

change Downloads page on R-nimble.org to reflect new version; creating link for newly-deprecated version at bottom

put new user manual in /web/R-nimble/wordpress/manuals
and change symlink to point to newest pdf

make a posting about the release on the webpage: click New Post (or maybe Posts â€”> New Post) then the post title should automatically go in the news roll on the right of the main page (include R as a tag if you want it picked up by R-bloggers)

(make sure post is set up as a blog entry)

add info on new release to release notes page

update NEWS info on webpage as high-level summary of NEWS in package

update version numbering on license and citation page and 'What is Nimble' page

rebuild and post manual and put new version of manual in inst/doc
git tag the manual repository

send notice to nimble-announce, nimble-users as christopher.paciorek@gmail.com (i.e., from the email of your admin status)

make sure to merge devel into master branch and create a branch for the new version
git checkout master
git merge devel
git commit -am'merged new version onto master'

probably best at this poitn also to merge master onto devel

git tag -a v0.3 -m 'NIMBLE version 0.3 release, December 31, 2014'
git push --tags    ## this is how you push *tags* to the remote

# make tag for nimble-docs too
git tag -a v0.5 -m 'NIMBLE version 0.5 release, April 6, 2016'
git push --tags    ## this is how you push *tags* to the remote

before release to CRAN put "$FLIBS" at end of last line in src/Makevars.in
and comment out rstan usage as in cran_0.5 branch on CJP machine

### Building of Windows version (instructions from DT)

put this in build.bat:
=====
@echo off
cd Documents\GitHub\nimble\packages
R CMD INSTALL --build nimble
=====

Then:
press WindowsButton-R, which opens the "Run" dialogue.
type "command" and press enter, to open a dos prompt.  (PowerShell is better, but don't need it for this).
if you're in the directory with the batch file (build.bat), then just type "build" at the prompt.

Not clear (should check with DTL) if the resulting installed package can then simply be zipped and if that is equivalent to what CRAN does when it builds the Windows binary.

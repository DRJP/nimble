make sure NEWS is updated with info on changes in latest release

update DESCRIPTION and INSTALL with current version number

for version on nimble website, remove FLIBS from Makevars.in
for CRAN, we need it in there, but it prevents easy source installation on Macs without getting the right version of libgfortran

R CMD build nimble
R CMD INSTALL nimble_${VERSION}.tar.gz
# before running prep_pkg make sure there is a config.R in nimble/R - copy over from another repos if needed but it should not be in the repository per DTL instructions
./prep_pkg # this creates man pages and updates NAMESPACE; note various warnings of things that can go wrong in prep_pkg and make sure these don't happen

warning about extra space in Rd files occurs (perhaps because of new Roxygen?) in argument lists where \item{} is separated from teh following {} by a newline and some spaces due to indentation appear. A 'fix' is to manually remove the spaces from the Rd files.
This also should work:
for file in `ls nimble/man`; do
    if [ -e /tmp/tmp.Rd ]; then
       rm -rf /tmp/tmp.Rd
    fi
     /bin/cp -i nimble/man/$file /tmp/tmp.Rd 
     sed ':begin;$!N;s/\(\item{.*}\)\n\s*/\1/;tbegin;P;D' /tmp/tmp.Rd > nimble/man/$file
done

run tests
in particular check exact MCMC results vs previous versions (ignore differences in compilation log info)
Rscript -e "library(nimble, lib.loc='/tmp/nimble'); library(testthat); test_package('nimble','mcmc')" > test-mcmc-results-v${VERSION}
diff test-mcmc-results-v0.4-1 test-mcmc-results-v${VERSION}

R CMD build nimble
R CMD check --as-cran nimble_${VERSION}.tar.gz
# officially this should be done on a development build of R, such as in a docker instance

login to nature.berkeley.edu: ssh to your_calnet_id@nature.berkeley.edu and use CalNet password
cd /web/R-nimble/wordpress/src/contrib

cp new .tar.gz there

chmod go+w nimble_${VERSION}.tar.gz

./writePackages

go to website: R-nimble.org/login and login 

change Downloads page on R-nimble.org to reflect new version; creating link for newly-deprecated version at bottom

make a posting about the release on the webpage: click New Post (or maybe Posts â€”> New Post) then the post title should automatically go in the news roll on the right of the main page

(make sure post is set up as a blog entry)

update NEWS info on webpage as high-level summary of NEWS in package

update version numbering on license and citation page

rebuild and post manual

send notice to nimble-announce, nimble-users as christopher.paciorek@gmail.com (i.e., from the email of your admin status)

make sure to merge devel into master branch and create a branch for the new version
git checkout master
git merge devel
git commit -am'merged new version onto master'

git tag -a v0.3 -m 'NIMBLE version 0.3 release, December 31, 2014'
git push --tags    ## this is how you push *tags* to the remote


before release to CRAN put "$FLIBS" at end of last line in src/Makevars.in

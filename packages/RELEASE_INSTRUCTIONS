make sure NEWS is updated with info on changes in latest release

update DESCRIPTION and INSTALL with current version number

R CMD build nimble
R CMD INSTALL nimble_${VERSION}.tar.gz
# before running prep_pkg make sure there is a config.R in nimble/R - copy over from another repos if needed but it should not be in the repository per DTL instructions
./prep_pkg # this creates man pages and updates NAMESPACE

warning about extra space in Rd files occurs (perhaps because of new Roxygen?) in argument lists where \item{} is separated from teh following {} by a newline and some spaces due to indentation appear. A 'fix' is to manually remove the spaces from the Rd files.
This also should work:
for file in `ls nimble/man`; do
     /bin/cp -f nimble/man/$file /tmp/tmp.Rd 
     sed ':begin;$!N;s/\(\item{.*}\)\n\s*/\1/;tbegin;P;D' /tmp/tmp.Rd > nimble/man/$file
done
